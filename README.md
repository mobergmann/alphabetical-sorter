# alphabetical-sorter
A website that sorts a given text line by line by alphabet, using the MergeSort algorithm.

An uppercase letter is weighted lighter than a lowercase letter, with the following letter being weighted even lighter.

```
A -> a -> B -> b -> ...
```

Attention, there can be performance issues if the text contains too many characters, because sorting is done every time a word is typed in.
Work around this problem by simply prewriting the text and copying it in.
